function JitteringBackTex_RFObj(jitterSeq, checkersN, ...
    waitframes, framesN, objContrast, backTex, pdStim)
    % Screen is divided in background and object.
    % background will display the given texture and will jitter it around
    % as specified by jitterSeq.
    % Object will be random binary checkers.
    % The time of the presentation comes in through framesN and if it is
    % longer than jitterSeq, then the jitter is repeated as many times as
    % needed. In this way you can have either:
    %   one background and one object
    %   one background with different objects
    %   different backgrounds with one object
    %
    % This procedure can also be used for reverse grating backgrounds, just
    % define the background to be the grating texture and define jitterSeq
    % to something like jitterSeq = [J 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -J 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    % were the J is the size of the jump and the 0s are the frames where
    % the background is still
    % jitterSeq:    an array describing how many pixels to jump
    %               at each frame (+ to the right, - to the left)
    % checkerN:     Number of checkers in either horizontal or vertical
    %               direction
    % waitFrames:   how often is the Flip going to be called?
    %               in general this will be either 1 or 2
    % framesN:      framesN/60 = totalLength of the presentation
    % backTex:      the texture to show in the background.
