function texture = maskMatrix(matrix, radia, saccadeSize, mode)
    % Given a matrix, generate a texture that has matrix everywhere except
    % in the mask (which depends on mode). The mask is the superposition of
    % 2 circles and a rectangle. The rectangle is centered on the screen 
    % and has height radia and width saccadeSize, the circles are centerd
    % at +- [saccadeSize/2 0] + screen.center and have radia = "radia"
